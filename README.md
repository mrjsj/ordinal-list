# Ordinal List

Ordinal List is a Python library that extends the functionality of Python's built-in list to use ordinal numbers for indexing. This allows users to access list elements using ordinal notations like '1st', '2nd', '3rd', etc., instead of zero-based indexing.

## Features

- Easy to use interface similar to Python's native list.
- Supports negative indexing similar to Python lists.
- Raises clear and descriptive errors for invalid inputs.

## Installation

To install the Ordinal List library, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install ordinal-list
```

This will download and install the latest version of Ordinal List from the Python Package Index (PyPI). After installation, you can import and use the library in your Python projects.

## Examples

Here's how to get started with the Ordinal List library:

```python
>>> from ordinal_list import OrdinalList
```

Create an OrdinalList with some fruits
```python
>>> ordinal_list = OrdinalList(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
```
Access elements using ordinal indices

```python
>>> print(ordinal_list["1st"])
apple
>>> print(ordinal_list["2nd"])
banana
>>> print(ordinal_list["3rd"])
cherry
>>> print(ordinal_list["-1st"])
cherry
```

Negative ordinals are also supported, as shown in the example above.

If you try to access an element with an invalid ordinal, the library will raise a descriptive error:
```python
>>> try:
>>>    print(ordinal_list["0th"]) # Invalid ordinal, will raise an error
>>> except Exception as e:
>>>    print(e)
```


You can also set items using ordinal indices:

```python
>>> ordinal_list["1st"] = "strawberry"
>>> print(ordinal_list["1st"])
strawberry
```

And you can extend the list with more items:

```python
>>> ordinal_list.extend(["kiwi", "mango"])
>>> print(ordinal_list["5th"])
mango
```

There is also a great helper method for programatically iterating an OrdinalList:

```python
>>> from ordinal_list import ordinal_range

>>> ordinal_list = OrdinalList(["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"])
>>> for ordinal in ordinal_range("1st", "5th"):
>>>    print(ordinal_list[ordinal])
apple
banana
cherry
date
elderberry
```
